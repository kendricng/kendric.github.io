This is my first post using GitHub pages + Hugo. In the past, I have attempted to maintain a website in a couple of iterations, namely:
1. Tumblr (before it went NSFW): around 2010-2012
2. Wordpress: around 2014-2017
3. Jekyll + AWS: around 2017-2018
4. Medium: 2018-2019
5. Ghost: around 2021

(TODO: I should look at my past history and see if I can find them.)

Back then, I had thought that having a personal/professional website was important for me to maintain. I had seen other developers have their own technical websites, and I thought I should do the same. 

However, I couldn't justify having to pay Namecheap/GoDaddy and some hosting service a recurring fee to keep it up. More importantly, I didn't have a clear reason why I should maintain such a website. Also, I have other social media accounts that I use frequently, especially LinkedIn and Twitter, where I get the information that I need.

## What Changed

I realized recently that I had gone through so many changes personally and professionally, and I didn't have a central place to appreciate that. While I don't think I'll be a frequent blogger, I am starting to realize the value of having something to go back to once in a while.

Also, I was looking into finding a way to distill the new knowledge that I'm getting from studying machine learning. So it's a good plus to have as well.

As with my past websites, this is a super TBD. But we shall see where this round might go!
